# Local-Post-Comments-Service
## Simple local post-comments service I built using -ERN stack.

_(I decided not to use Mongo or any DB for such a tiny purpose)_

Features:
- Post service
- Comment service
- Moderation service
- Query service
- Events service
- Client

Would you try to run it locally, first go `npm install` in each service directory, then `npm start`.
